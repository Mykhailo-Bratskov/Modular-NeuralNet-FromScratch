# Modular-NeuralNet-FromScratch
This Modular-NeuralNet-FromScratch is a highly customizable Multilayer Perceptron. The network can take different forms as the number of layers and the number of nodes within each layer can be adjusted to a specific purpose. Additionally, the network involves L2 regularization to prevent overfitting, where the user can define lambda themselves.
